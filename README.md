## Why Jekyll with GitBook

GitBook is an amazing frontend style to present and organize contents (such as book chapters
and blogs) on Web. The typical to deploy GitBook at [Github Pages][1]
is building HTML files locally and then push to Github repository, usually to the `gh-pages`
branch. It's quite annoying to repeat such workload and make it hard for people do version
control via git for when there are generated HTML files to be staged in and out.

This theme takes style definition out of generated GitBook site and provided the template
for Jekyll to rendering markdown documents to HTML, thus the whole site can be deployed
to [Github Pages][1] without generating and uploading HTML bundle every time when there are
changes to the original repo.

## How to Get Started

This theme can be used just as other [Jekyll themes][1].

## Code highlight

The code highlight style is configurable the following entry in `_config.yaml`:

```yaml
syntax_highlighter_style: colorful
```

The default code highlight style is `colorful`, the full supported styles can be found from [the rouge repository][6]. Customized
style can be added to [./gitbook/rouge/](./gitbook/rouge/).

## How to generate TOC

The jekyll-gitbook theme leverages [jekyll-toc][4] to generate the *Contents* for the page.
The TOC feature is not enabled by default. To use the TOC feature, modify the TOC
configuration in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
toc:
    enabled: true
    h_min: 1
    h_max: 3
```

## Google Analytics, etc.

The jekyll-gitboook theme supports embedding the [Google Analytics][7], [CNZZ][8] and [Application Insights][9] website analytical tools with the following
minimal configuration in `_config.yaml`:

```yaml
tracker:
  google_analytics: "<YOUR GOOGLE ANALYTICS KEY, e.g, UA-xxxxxx-x>"
```

Similarly, CNZZ can be added with the following configuration in `_config.yaml`

```yaml
tracker:
  cnzz: "<YOUR CNZZ ANALYTICS KEY, e.g., xxxxxxxx>"
```

Application Insights can be added with the following configuration in `_config.yaml`

```yaml
tracker:
  application_insights: "<YOUR APPLICATION INSIGHTS CONNECTION STRING>"
```

## Extra StyleSheet or Javascript elements

You can add extra CSS or JavaScript references using configuration collections:

- extra_css: for additional style sheets. If the url does not start by http, the path must be relative to the root of the site, without a starting `/`.
- extra_header_js: for additional scripts to be included in the `<head>` tag, after the `extra_css` has been added. If the url does not start by http, the path must be relative to the root of the site, without a starting `/`.
- extra_footer_js: for additional scripts to be included at the end of the HTML document, just before the site tracking script. If the url does not start by http, the path must be relative to the root of the site, without a starting `/`.

## Customizing font settings

The fonts can be customized by modifying the `.book.font-family-0` and `.book.font-family-1` entry in [`./gitbook/custom.css`][10],

```css
.book.font-family-0 {
    font-family: Georgia, serif;
}
.book.font-family-1 {
    font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

## Cover image inside pages

The jekyll-gitbook theme supports adding a cover image to a specific page by adding
a `cover` field to the page metadata:

```diff
  ---
  title: Page with cover image
  author: Tao He
  date: 2022-05-24
  category: Jekyll
  layout: post
+ cover: /jekyll-gitbook/dinosaur.gif
  ---
```

The effect can be previewed from
