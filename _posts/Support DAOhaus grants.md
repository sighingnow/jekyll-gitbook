# Support DAOhaus Grants

[![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/GLPhZrUhTRGBd8rOBCh18A/badge)](https://hackmd.io/GLPhZrUhTRGBd8rOBCh18A)


If you would like to get involved in helping DAOhaus to obtain Grant Funding, this message is for you.

We have created a simple spreadhseet that is open to members of Warcamp to fill out as they see fit, with information such as: 
- _Grant Giver_
- _Grant Amount offerred_
- _Requirements for a Successful Grant_
- _Appropriateness of the Grant considering requirements_
- _Relevant Contact Information_
- _Grant Owner (writer or steward)_
- _Useful notes that can help provide context to the Owner (Grant writer or Steward)_


We welcome everyone who is interested to add resources or context in the areas you are most knowledgable or keen to support. 

If you would like to write a grant proposal or have already written one, please add the Grant Giving organization along with any information you have already collected to the spreadsheet so we can do a better job to track our efforts organizationally and reduce duplicate work. Grant writers can pick up grants by assigning themselves under the `Owner` column of the spreadsheet

If you are looking for examples on successful grant proposals to help provide guidance on grant writing, navigate to the `Awarded` column and see proposals with a `yes` response. (we have not yet submitted a grant proposal so no successful proposals have been recorded). Alternatively, you can refer to active grant proposals by seeing the `Status` column and selecting the appropriate identifier from the drop down. 

Stay involved by bookmarking the `grant seekers thread` under the **alchemists channel** 

> Props to @boilerrat for putting the spreadsheet together and getting momentum behind this!
