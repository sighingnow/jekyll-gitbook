1. Dotphrases
2. Cerner Shortcuts
    - Cerner is the Hospital's EMR
    - Useful, but dumb at the same time
    - Computers are very good at large computations and repetition
        - They are terrible at complex task or ones that have multiple variables
            - You must use this to your advantage
                - We as humans are pretty good at multivariable problems and having a device to do our repetitive tasks leave us more time to think about complicated problems
                - Don't be like computers, be smart and use dictation, dotphrases, and favorites
    - This being said, Cerner is extra stupid. I've attached a few modules on how to make Cerner "smarter" and work more efficiently for YOU
