  + This application was mostly centered around current workstreams and funding for audit, so as it stands shouldn't need a lot more roadmao information.
  + Do we need more info on roadmap and budget?
    + How do we get that info? [Core Strategy July Kick Off](https://hackmd.io/@daohaus/Hk7Yd7siq)

## Radicle

### notes
> [name=boilerrat]
>Priority feels lower on this one than Moloch and Gnosis so no real focus should be placed here until the other two are complete. Application has a good portion completed and a lot of the sticking points should be figured out from other applications.

_although... it could be a good idea to concentrate on this one as a way of discovery for other applications, probably too risky but worth talking about._


## Gnosis
[Process](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/readme-gnosisdao-governance-process/736)

https://hackmd.io/v8GAwztVTmWUiN2Kna_cAQ


### notes
> [name=boilerrat]The application that was being completed was only asking for 10K from the Gnosis Ecosystem Fund. This grant stream has been discontinued and moved to gnosis DAO. I believe the partnership document was something else. Either way, I think that this application would come together very quickly after the Moloch DAO one is complete, with a few modifications



## Protocol

[Process](https://grants.protocol.ai/)
[RFP-000](https://grants.protocol.ai/prog/rfp-000_open_rfp/)

### notes
> [name=boilerrat]They have a few different rfp's available. Many are centered around individuals or small teams. The rfp we would likely apply under, if applying for a grant, would be RFP-000. Which is the most open ended of their grants. Many of their grants are of an academic nature and our application would best be along that angle. There can be an argument that DAOhaus is just as much an R&D team as it is a product team.
