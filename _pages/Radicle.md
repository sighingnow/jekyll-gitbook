## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this is an application for retroactive funding (i.e. work that is completed and committed into a codebase), please drop any related PRs in this section.

### Overview

Moloch contracts are far superior to other DAO protocols, but there is no easy way to summon a Moloch DAO. With Baal v3, the functionality is even more composable and even more powerful. DAOhaus is building all of their tooling in the open and will provide everything we have built and discovered to the public as an open source public good. This includes the contracts, SDK componenet libraries, process and documentation.
We currently provide support for these products and play an active role in guiding community developers that want to build on top of the products. We would like to continue to provide that support and further development in the DAO space into the future.

## Project Description :page_facing_up:

We have worked very hard to bring this project as far as we have. We currently have 29 core contributors to the DAOhaus project that have contributed in many more ways than can be captured within the github milestones for the product development. This includes countless hours of advocacy for the DAO and Web 3 space.

DAOhaus community member have published 90 times now on various publishing formats. We have also attracted over 15,000 twiter follower which we have used for the good of the space and community. We also hold regulary community calls on Discord where we discuss a wide range of topics that are relevant to the space.

Due to the recent downturn in the markets our runway was dramatically cut, at a time when we are so close to completeing a major accomplishment in the DAO space. We believe the release of an audited v3 Baal contract and UI, while making everything open source will be a hugely important step for the development of DAOs and Web 3 in general. Many of the cuts we have had to make were cultural, as we focus on completion. So a major part of this grant application is to ensure DAOhaus' core team, warcamp, have the runway to complete all the below stated milestones as well as to pay for an audit on our contracts.

We currently have an estimate of 90,000 DAI from quantstamp to perform the audit. We feel this is an important process to ensure the safety of the contracts for the public.

After our major milestones below are complete, we will still require runway to provide support and further development of the product, as there are many composable parts involved in a moloch DAO.  

## Deliverables :nut_and_bolt:

Please list the deliverables of the project in as much detail as possible. Please also estimate the amount of work required and try to divide the project into meaningful milestones.

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project
- **Full-time equivalent (FTE):** Amount of time (in days) required for a single person to complete this project ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent))
- **Total Costs:** Amount of Payment in USD for the whole project.
